Heap is binary tree in which
every node has a value greater
than its child nodes.

A heap can be represented using
an array also. In such a case
for node n
Its left child is at position : 2*n +1
Its left child is at position : 2*n +2
Its parent is at position : (n -1) /2

Two imp operations on heap are
Reheap up 
===========
  A nodes value is compared with
  its parent node value
  if child node value is greater then
  child and parent are swapped.
  The operation is continued as long as
   child value remains greater.

Reheap down
=============
  A parent node is compared with 
  greater of its childs.
  If parent node is smaller then 
  they are swapped.
   Repeat the same operation as 
   long as the parent is smaller.
 =============================

Heap Sort Algo

1) Accept array as input
2)Perform reheap up for every element
and convert the input array into heap
3) Recall heap has root as the 
largest value. Swap root (array[0])
with last element of array.
4) Consider array size as decremented
by one.
5) Perform reheap down on array[0]
and remake the array as a heap.
6) until array size becomes zero
go to step 3
